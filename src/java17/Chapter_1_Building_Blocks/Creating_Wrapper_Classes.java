    //there is also calueOf() variant that converts a String  into the wrapper class. For example.

    int primitive = Integer.parseInt("123"); //Converts a String to an int primitive
    Integer wrapper = Integer.valueOf("123");// Converts a String to an Integer wrapper class.

    /* Some wrapper classes contain additional helper methods for working with numbers.

    max (int num1, int num2), which returns the largest of the two numbers.
    min (int num1, int num2), which returns the smallest of the two numbers.
    sum (int num1, int num2), which adds the two numbers.

    /* any examples

    Also note that primitive types cannot be used in Collections, only objects.
    Therefore, the solution is to use Wrappers.

    "Non-primitive" types allocate space on the heap and put pressure on the garbage collector.

    Primitives allocate on the stack and management is simple and fast. They even waste a lot of memory because of
    the natural overhead that objects have. Again this has changed a bit in some cases.

    Primitive types will not have NullPointerException issues.

    In the specific case of Java, the syntax of primitive types is more convenient than non-primitive types.
     Primitive types don't need to use equals(), for example, but that may be changing, at least in part.
